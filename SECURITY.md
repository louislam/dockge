# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Please report security issues to https://github.com/louislam/dockge/security/advisories/new.
1. Please also create an empty security issue to alert me, as GitHub Advisories do not send a notification, I probably will miss it without this. https://github.com/louislam/dockge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=help&template=security.md

Do not use the public issue tracker or discuss it in public as it will cause more damage.

## Do you accept other 3rd-party bug bounty platforms?

At this moment, I DO NOT accept other bug bounty platforms, because I am not familiar with these platforms and someone has tried to send a phishing link to me by doing this already. To minimize my own risk, please report through GitHub Advisories only. I will ignore all 3rd-party bug bounty platforms emails.
