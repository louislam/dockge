## 🔧 How to Install

Requirements:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 20+ / Podman
- (Podman only) podman-docker (Debian: `apt install podman-docker`)
- OS:
  - Major Linux distros that can run Docker/Podman such as:
     - ✅ Ubuntu
     - ✅ Debian (Bullseye or newer)
     - ✅ Raspbian (Bullseye or newer)
     - ✅ CentOS
     - ✅ Fedora
     - ✅ ArchLinux
  - ❌ Debian/Raspbian Buster or lower is not supported
  - ❌ Windows (Will be supported later)
- Arch: armv7, arm64, amd64 (a.k.a x86_64)

### Basic

- Default Stacks Directory: `/opt/stacks`
- Default Port: 5001

```
# Create directories that store your stacks and stores Dockge's stack
mkdir -p /opt/stacks /opt/dockge
cd /opt/dockge

# Download the compose.yaml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louislam/dockge/master/compose.yaml --output compose.yaml

# Start the server
docker compose up -d

# If you are using docker-compose V1 or Podman
# docker-compose up -d
```

Dockge is now running on http://localhost:5001

### Advanced

If you want to store your stacks in another directory, you can generate your compose.yaml file by using the following URL with custom query strings.

```
# Download your compose.yaml
curl "https://dockge.kuma.pet/compose.yaml?port=5001&stacksPath=/opt/stacks" --output compose.yaml
```

- port=`5001`
- stacksPath=`/opt/stacks`

Also, once compose is generated/downloaded, add the `PUID` and `PGID` section below to your compose `environment:` section to set stack ownership, otherwise default is `root`

```
      # Both PUID and PGID must be set for it to do anything
      - PUID=1000 # Set the stack file/dir ownership to this user
      - PGID=1000 # Set the stack file/dir ownership to this group
```

Interactive compose.yaml generator is available on: 
https://dockge.kuma.pet

### -OR-
Copy and paste your compose from the following:

If you want to store your stacks in another directory, you can change the `DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR` environment variable and volumes.

compose:
```
services:
  dockge:
    image: louislam/dockge:1
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      # Host Port:Container Port
      - 5001:5001
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./data:/app/data
        
      # If you want to use private registries, you need to share the auth file with Dockge:
      # - /root/.docker/:/root/.docker

      # Stacks Directory
      # Your stacks directory in the host (The paths inside container must be the same as the host)
      # ⚠️ If you did it wrong, your data could end up be written into a wrong path.
      # ✔️ CORRECT EXAMPLE: - /my-stacks:/my-stacks (Both paths match)
      # ❌ WRONG EXAMPLE: - /docker:/my-stacks (Both paths do not match)
      - /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks
    environment:
      # Tell Dockge where your stacks directory is
      - DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR=/opt/stacks
      # Both PUID and PGID must be set for it to do anything
      - PUID=1000 # Set the stack file/dir ownership to this user
      - PGID=1000 # Set the stack file/dir ownership to this group
```

## How to Update

```bash
cd /opt/dockge
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

## Motivations

- I have been using Portainer for some time, but for the stack management, I am sometimes not satisfied with it. For example, sometimes when I try to deploy a stack, the loading icon keeps spinning for a few minutes without progress. And sometimes error messages are not clear.
- Try to develop with ES Module + TypeScript

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

## 🔐 Proxy Authentication

Dockge supports authentication via HTTP headers set by reverse proxies. This allows you to integrate with identity providers like **Authentik**, **Authelia**, **OAuth2 Proxy**, **Keycloak**, and others.

### Configuration

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_HEADER` | The HTTP header containing the authenticated username | *(disabled)* |
| `DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_AUTO_CREATE` | Automatically create users on first login | `false` |
| `DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_LOGOUT_URL` | URL to redirect to when user logs out | *(none)* |

### Supported Headers

The header name is configurable. Common headers used by identity providers:

| Provider | Header Name |
|----------|-------------|
| Authelia | `Remote-User` |
| Authentik | `X-authentik-username` |
| OAuth2 Proxy | `X-Auth-Request-User` |
| Traefik Forward Auth | `X-Forwarded-User` |

### Example: Authentik

```yaml
services:
  dockge:
    image: louislam/dockge:1
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 5001:5001
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./data:/app/data
      - /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks
    environment:
      - DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR=/opt/stacks
      - DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_HEADER=X-authentik-username
      - DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_AUTO_CREATE=true
      - DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_LOGOUT_URL=https://auth.example.com/outpost.goauthentik.io/sign_out
```

### Example: Authelia

```yaml
services:
  dockge:
    image: louislam/dockge:1
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 5001:5001
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./data:/app/data
      - /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks
    environment:
      - DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR=/opt/stacks
      - DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_HEADER=Remote-User
      - DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_AUTO_CREATE=true
      - DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_LOGOUT_URL=https://auth.example.com/logout
```

### Example: Traefik with Forward Auth

```yaml
services:
  dockge:
    image: louislam/dockge:1
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./data:/app/data
      - /opt/stacks:/opt/stacks
    environment:
      - DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR=/opt/stacks
      - DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_HEADER=X-Forwarded-User
      - DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_AUTO_CREATE=true
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.dockge.rule=Host(`dockge.example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.dockge.middlewares=authentik@docker"
```

### Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: When using proxy authentication, ensure that:

1. **Direct access is blocked** - Users should only access Dockge through your reverse proxy. The proxy header can be spoofed if users can connect directly.
2. **Your reverse proxy strips incoming auth headers** - Prevent users from injecting fake authentication headers.
3. **Use HTTPS** - Always use TLS between clients and your reverse proxy.

### First-Time Setup with Proxy Auth

When `DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_AUTO_CREATE=true`:
- The first user to authenticate via the proxy becomes an admin
- No manual setup is required
- Users are automatically created when they first log in

When `DOCKGE_AUTH_PROXY_AUTO_CREATE=false`:
- Users must be manually created in the database before they can log in
- Useful for restricting access to pre-approved users only

## FAQ

#### "Dockge"?

"Dockge" is a coinage word which is created by myself. I originally hoped it sounds like `Dodge`, but apparently many people called it `Dockage`, it is also acceptable.

The naming idea came from Twitch emotes like `sadge`, `bedge` or `wokege`. They all end in `-ge`.

#### Can I manage a single container without `compose.yaml`?

The main objective of Dockge is to try to use the docker `compose.yaml` for everything. If you want to manage a single container, you can just use Portainer or Docker CLI.

#### Can I manage existing stacks?

Yes, you can. However, you need to move your compose file into the stacks directory:

1. Stop your stack
2. Move your compose file into `/opt/stacks/<stackName>/compose.yaml`
3. In Dockge, click the " Scan Stacks Folder" button in the top-right corner's dropdown menu
4. Now you should see your stack in the list

#### Is Dockge a Portainer replacement?

Yes or no. Portainer provides a lot of Docker features. While Dockge is currently only focusing on docker-compose with a better user interface and better user experience.

If you want to manage your container with docker-compose only, the answer may be yes.

If you still need to manage something like docker networks, single containers, the answer may be no.

#### Can I install both Dockge and Portainer?

Yes, you can.

## Others

Dockge is built on top of [Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/). `compose.yaml`  also known as `docker-compose.yml`.
